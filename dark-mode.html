                <h2 class="h2">Dark Mode</h2>
                <h3 class="h3">Overview</h3>
                <p class="body-copy">
                    Frost users provided ample feedback that the mobile app was blinding when monitoring their finances later in the evening and and night as well as questioning why we were behind other apps in supporting dark mode.
                </p>
                <p class="body-copy">
                    In a response to the overwhelming feedback and to meet market parity I worked with the mobile Product Owner and the mobile dev teams to establish guidelines, principles, and lead the design implementation.
                </p>

                <h3 class="h3">Problem</h3>
                <p class="body-copy">
                    We were working within a fixed color palette and needed to utilize what colors Marketing had already approved.
                </p>
                <p class="body-copy">
                    Furthermore as a Zelle partner, we needed to provide screens for the entire experience in dark mode as we were the first of their partners to adopt dark mode.
                </p>

                <h3 class="h3">Solution</h3>
                <p class="body-copy">
                    The solution included providing developers an alternate appearance to each of the components found in Frost's Aurora design system as well as writing up a series of guidelines and principles around this new theme to fill the gaps where the element in question was not a part of the design system.

                <h3 class="h3">Results</h3>
                <p class="body-copy">60% adoption rate</p>
                <p class="body-copy">Positive reception from customers in the App Store and Play Store</p>
