                <h2 class="h2">Streamlining Money Movement</h2>
                <h3 class="h3">Overview</h3>
                <p class="body-copy">
                    I did some research and testing around how Frost and other financial institutions would be able to simplify the Money Movement (transfers, bill payments, P2P payments) experience on the front-end for their users by accomplishing all those tasks from the same screen.
                </p>

                <h3 class="h3">Problem</h3>
                <p class="body-copy">
                    The majority of users in our baseline testing struggled to identify which of the Money Movement rails they needed to interact with to get their money from A to B.
                </p>
                <p class="body-copy">
                    Research participants explored all three move money tabs and their associated landing pages before identifying the correct option.
                </p>

                <h3 class="h3">Solution</h3>
                <p class="body-copy">
                    If we creating a single, dynamic flow, we could eliminate the points of confusion and frustration and manage which rail actually performs the transaction on the back end.

                <h3 class="h3">Results</h3>
                <p class="body-copy">This experience never made it into production but participants were thrilled and wished for something like this.</p>
                <p class="body-copy">Participants commented, "That was much easier than expected. Everything was right there, simple and easy", or "This is quick, efficient, and I have confidence that [the transaction] will go through" and much more.</p>
