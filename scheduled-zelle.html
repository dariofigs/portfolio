                <h3 class="h3">Overview</h3>
                <p class="body-copy">
                    We opted in to a series of Zelle features that would allow users to set up payments in advance and create recurring series. For this to be accomplished, I needed to rethink the architecture to allow for this new functionality.
                </p>

                <h3 class="h3">Problem</h3>
                <p class="body-copy">
                    The previous experience only allowed users to make a one-time payment for today's date. We had previously built the experiences for transfers and bill payments couldn't support all the frequency options we needed here.
                </p>
                <img src="images/scheduled-zelle/recurring-flow.png" alt="">
                <h3 class="h3">Solution</h3>
                <p class="body-copy">
                    After exploring numerous iterations and researching competitors, we created a flow that changed for each frequency option.
                </p>
                <p class="body-copy">
                    Furthermore, to keep users from feeling overwhelmed, I worked with our content strategy team to provide some helper text throughout the experience to break out chunks of the experience and give more insight into what we were asking.

                <h3 class="h3">Results</h3>
                <p class="body-copy">
                    TBD. Early research indicates a faster time on task and increased success rate.
